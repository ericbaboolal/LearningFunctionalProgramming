# Higher Order Functions in PureScript

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to introduce Higher Order Functions using the PureScript language

## Getting Setup

**Prerequisite:** Node JS installed

Install PureScript

```
npm install -g purescript pulp bower
```

Open the REPL

```
> cd LearningFunctionalProgramming/FunctionalExamples/HigherOrderFunctions/purescript
> pulp repl
```

Note: If using VSCode, there are two plugins that might be helpful: `PureScript IDE` and `PureScript Language Support`

Once in the REPL these commands will be helpful

```
:r  - will 'sync' the REPL with any changes you've made to the file
:q  - will exit you out of the REPL
```

## Doing the Examples

In your favorite text editor, open the `purescript` directory.

If you are unfamiliar with the purescript syntax start here:

```
src/BasicSyntax.purs
```

Then move onto:

```
src/HigherOrderFunctions.purs
```
