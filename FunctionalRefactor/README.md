# Refactoring Problems

Take a look at the [Refactor-Spectacular](https://github.com/gregberns/refactor-spectacular/) repository for examples of code that can be used to practice refactoring.

## Why?

Why would you want to practice refactoring?

* The better your refactoring skills, the better you'll write your code in the first place
* Being able to **properly** refactor poorly structured code can make an bugs easy to see
* Improves your code reading skills
* Helps you building a solid mental model of what a poorly piece of code is doing (even if you don't use the refactored code in production)
