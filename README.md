# Learning Function Programming

This repository is full of things I've written (mostly incomplete and bad) and papers I've found useful.

# Papers

Check out the 'Papers' folder for writings, mostly older than I am, which will rock your world once you understand them.

# People 

Here are some people in the functional programming community worth paying attention to. (This is a very short, very incomplete list)

# Functional Examples

This was an attempt to explore with some functional code snippets and ideas.

# Ramblings

Mostly disjoint and incomplete thoughts on why FP concepts have made me a less shitty developer. 

# Notes

Notes on things I really dont understand, but hope to one day, but probaly wont.
