# The Best Functional Programming Talks

The following are talks that will help you understand different aspects of how and why functional programming is such a powerful paradigm.

## Simple Made Easy

[Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) is a must watch talk. I'd write a summary but it wouldn't do it justice. Just watch.

## Functional Design Patterns
