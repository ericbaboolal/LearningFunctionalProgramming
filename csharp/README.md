# Functional Programming in C#

## Project Objective

The best way to learn functional concepts is to actually implement the functions.

There are a set of data structures and functions that are used over and over which are great to start out with.

Data Structures:

* Option / Maybe
* Either
* List

Functions:

* Filter
* Map
* Bind

## Your Objective

The module `Option.cs` gives you an implementation of the Option data structure.

Your objective is to go into the `OptionTests.cs` and implement all the functions for Option. Start by implementing `Functional.OptionExt.Filter<>`, then uncomment lines in `OptionFilterTests.Filter_Evens`.

Once the test passes, move onto the next test and make it pass.

Once Filter is passing, move on to `Map`. Implement the function signature and logic. Then make tests pass.
